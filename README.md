# WorkTimeLogger

This is a personal project to help me process my times into Harvest and Jira. During my work day, I write the time I spend in different tasks in an Excel spreadsheet. This tool helps me aggregate and format that info to easily write it into Harvest and Jira.

TO-DO:
* Connecting to the Harvest and Jira API's to avoid all manual processing.
